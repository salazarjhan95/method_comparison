# Measuring the heat and the cold: Comparing approaches to thermal physiology in lizard studies

Jhan C. Salazar

For this manuscript, I ran a few phylogenetic analyses and created some cool figures. Here are the scripts and data we used. I prefer to separate each analysis and figure into its own .R file, so I have multiple .R files for each.

## Description
I divided the analysis and the dataset for the bootstrap analysis and for the phylogenetic analysis. 

## Figures
To do Figure 1 and 2 we used these scripts:
  
  Figure1_Density.R
  
  Figure2_Regression.R
